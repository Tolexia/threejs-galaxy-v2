New Galaxy Display made with Three.js following YouTuber Seabass' tutorial

## Pros : 

* The gaussian distribution is a game changer that makes a lot of concentration of stars in the center and less in the outer part
* Bloom and Haze add a more realistic aspect
* Working with sprites instead of points make possible to add specific properties and behaviour to each star

## Cons : 
* Is a lot performance expensive
